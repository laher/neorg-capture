# neorg-codecap

    **PRE-ALPHA** - breaking changes incoming soon.

Super basic capture module for neorg, for capturing notes referring to code.

I just wanted to capture a TODO with a popup, which captures the file/line, and its
associated git URL. It can also capture a git-diff for a file.

It's a little neorg module, but it's also a little vim plugin which does the capturing
(typically, outside of neorg) & then invokes the module.

NOTE: this began just as a quick hack while the neorg-gtd feature is unavailable.
Maybe this will eventually be superceded or reworked on top of GTD.

## Example usage

Given a file `neorg/lua/neorg.lua` with the following content in your git repo,
selected in visual mode:

```lua
--- Returns whether or not Neorg is loaded
---@return boolean
function neorg.is_loaded()
    return configuration.started
end
```

With the default mapping of `<leader>ccv`  (mapped to
`require'codecap'.cap('n', { inbox = 'vsplit' })`), you would first
See a single-line popup, where you might enter "Investigate is_loaded.",
and press `<cr>`.

You'd see a new vsplit showing `$workspace/inbox.norg`, with the following content
(imagine the `|` is the cursor).

```norg
* Inbox
- ( ) Investigate is_loaded.|
@code lua
--- Returns whether or not Neorg is loaded
---@return boolean
function neorg.is_loaded()
    return configuration.started
end
@end
See {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/blob/main/lua/neorg.lua#L130-L134}[neorg.lua#L130-L134]
```

The git link is produced by gitlinker.nvim. If the file weren't in git, then you'd
see a file link instead.

## Key mappings

Defaults mappings are as follows:

| mapping       | description    |
|---------------|----------------|
| `<leader>ccv` | capture then open inbox in a visual split |
| `<leader>ccs` | capture then open inbox in a horizontal split |
| `<leader>cce` | capture then open inbox into current pane |
| `<leader>cci` | open inbox |
| `<leader>ccd` | capture `git-diff` of current file, then open inbox. |


To keep these default, just call `setup({})` with an empty table:

```lua
require'codecap'.setup({})
```

You can override them when you setup `codecap`. These
apply normal/visual mode mappings as appropriate for each command:

```lua
require'codecap'.setup({ mappings = {
    ['<leader>ccv'] = 'vsplit',
    ['<leader>ccs'] = 'split',
    ['<leader>cce'] = 'edit',
    ['<leader>ccn'] = 'noshow',
    ['<leader>ccc'] = 'inbox',
    ['<leader>ccd'] = 'diff',
}})
```

Set `mappings = {}` if you don't want any mappings.

```lua
require'codecap'.setup({ mappings = {} })
```

### Manually adding mappings

You can define a mapping like: `require'codecap'.cap('n', { inbox = 'vsplit' })`

- `'n'` or `'v'` for normal/visual mode.
- `{ inbox = 'vsplit' }`, to dictate whether to display
the inbox.

The `codecap.cap()` function invokes `gitlinker` and then uses the result [or no
result] to invoke neorg commands.

## Neorg commands

- `:Neorg codecap inbox` - opens your inbox file. It's just for convenience.
I recommend linking to the inbox from your `index.norg`.

### Capturing todos

By themselves, the neorg module's capturing commands don't have gitlinker support.
(You need to invoke `codecap.cap()` as above for the gitlinker support).

- First parameter is the vim mode (`n` or `v`).
- If a URL is passed in as an additional parameter,
(which `require'codecap'.cap(...)` would do for you), then that is transformed
into a link.
- If no URL is passed to these `edit`/`vsplit`/`split`/`noshow` commands, they create
a link with a file reference instead. The link refers to the file & line number
of the current buffer.

- `:Neorg codecap [vplit|edit|split|noshow]` - open a small popup where you enter
a todo. The todo ends up in a workspace file called `inbox.norg`. The different
subcommands dictate whether & how to show the todo in the inbox.
- `:Neorg codecap diff` - similar to `edit` except it captures a diff of the whole
file, and it only works in `normal` mode.

## Known issues/limitations

- ~~Neorg can't currently open a file link with a line number `{/ file.txt:23}`.
See [PR](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/pull/903) - hopefully soon.~~
- The norg spec for file links doesn't support line number ranges, yet. So
file links will just show the first line.

## Plans

- [x] key mappings (visual, normal modes).
- Maybe variants on the same cap func.
  - [x] copying actual code blocks, not just gitlinks / file links.
  - [x] opening the inbox as you capture. Split,etc.
  - [ ] Tagging with a date.
- [x] Hopefully I'll add a visual mode command to enter the selected filename+linenums
into the todo entry.
- [x] capture git-diffs?
- Maybe a separate module for refiling/organising. Depends on GTD progress.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

First, you need a recent neovim, neorg and gitlinker.

- [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg).
- [Gitlinker](https://github.com/ruifm/gitlinker.nvim).

You can install them all through your favorite vim plugin manager.

Something like this but this is WIP
(I use lazy.nvim so other samples might not actually work)

  ```vim
  Plug 'nvim-neorg/neorg' | Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' | Plug 'ruifm/gitlinker.nvim' | Plug 'laher/neorg-codecap'
  ```

  You can then put this initial configuration in your `init.vim` file.

  TODO test the setup, add override key mappings.

  ```vim
  lua << EOF
  require('neorg').setup {
    load = {
        ["core.defaults"] = {},
        ...
        ["external.codecap"] = {},
    },
  }
  -- codecap.setup will sset up default mappings.
  -- codecap key mappings operate outside of neorg, so they are mapped outside too.
  require('codecap').setup {

  }
  EOF
  ```
